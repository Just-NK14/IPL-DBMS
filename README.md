# IPL Database Management System (DBMS) Project

## Overview
This project is a Database Management System (DBMS) for managing records related to the Indian Premier League (IPL). It allows users to view information about IPL teams, their squads, points tables for all seasons, and statistics for the current season. Additionally, administrators can log in to update bowling and batting statistics, add new players, update existing player details, and delete players.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Server Environment**: XAMPP (Apache, MySQL)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Just-NK14/IPL-DBMS.git
   
2. **Install XAMPP:**
   - Download and install XAMPP from [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

3. **Start the XAMPP server:**
   - Launch XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

4. **Open phpMyAdmin:**
   - Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
   - Create a new database named `ipl`.
   - Import the `ipl.sql` file provided in the repository into the `ipl` database.

5. **Move the project files:**
   - Move the cloned repository folder (`IPL-DBMS`) to the `htdocs` directory inside your XAMPP installation directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs`).

6. **Access the project:**
   - Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost/IPL-DBMS](http://localhost/IPL-DBMS) to access the project.

## Usage
- Once the project is set up and the database is imported, users can:
  - View information about IPL teams and their squads.
  - Access points tables for all seasons.
  - View statistics for the current season.
  - Administrators can log in to perform CRUD operations on bowling and batting statistics, as well as manage players (add, update, delete).
